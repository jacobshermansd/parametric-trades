```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Task 1

If you want to include a written response to a question, you can type it here. 

```{r}
# Code chunks begin and end with three tick marks.
# the {r} tells R Studio that this is R code.
# Comments can be written inside a code chunk by beginning the line with #.
# Include the code to complete an exercise here. For example:

1 + 1
```

## Task 2

You can organize and separate your responses using built-in header styles. 

### Task 2.1

#### Task 2.1.1

After typing some code in a code chunk, press each of the icons in the upper right corner of the code chuck to see what they do. 

Here's a blank code chunk for your next exercise response. You can type this directly each time you want a new code chunk, or you can press Ctrl+Alt+I.

```{r}
# Answer here.
```
