# Application of DoE to the Advanced Warfighting Simulation



By this point in the tutorial, you have all the skills needed to design experiments for two-level factors and fit a linear model to the results. Depending on the study, these may be the only analytic skills needed to meet the study objectives. So far, the datasets we've been working with have largely been built-in datasets from *R* packages or results from a simplified combat model. In this chapter, we'll make the leap from interacting with the simplified combat model to interacting with the Advanced Warfighting Simulation (AWARS). As a result, this chapter consists of a stand-alone R Markdown file on MCN-S. 

Topics covered in this chapter include:

* Working With AWARS Input Files
    + Text Files (input files and .ctl files)
    + Working With Strings and Regular Expressions
* APE Database
* Automating AWARS Runs With Bash
* Working With AWARS Output
  + Postprocessor Database
  + Playback Database
  + Efficient Queries
